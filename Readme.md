Dolphin is an emulator for running GameCube and Wii games on Windows,
Linux, macOS, and recent Android devices. It's licensed under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (GPLv2+).

Please read the [FAQ](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/) before using Dolphin.

## About this fork: GBA (Client-Stream)

This fork adds **GBA (Client-Stream)**, a new controller device for GameCube
ports that stream the integrated GBA emulation (the same core used for
GC-GBA link-cable titles, e.g. *Four Swords Adventures*) to a separate
device over the LAN, instead of showing it in a local window. The GBA
emulation itself still runs on the Dolphin machine; only its video, audio,
and button input travel over the network:

- Pick a GameCube port in **Controllers &rarr; GameCube Controllers** and set
  its device to **GBA (Client-Stream)**.
- Boot a game that uses the integrated GBA. Any port configured this way
  falls back to the normal local GBA pad binding whenever no client is
  connected, so it behaves exactly like **GBA (Integrated)** until a client
  attaches.
- From another device on the same network (phone, tablet, another
  computer, or a dedicated native client built against the same wire
  protocol), open `http://<dolphin-host-ip>:6800/` in a browser and pick a
  free player slot. No app or installation needed for the browser client.

The web client is a single self-contained page with no build step and no
external dependencies: fullscreen video sized to fit the window, an
on-screen D-pad/button overlay on touch devices (with optional Xbox/
PlayStation-style game controller binding via the Gamepad API), and a
keyboard-rebind panel on desktop.

Each connected GBA slot gets its own WebSocket connection on `6800 +
<device number>`, handled by a per-session reader thread (input, ping/pong,
disconnect) and writer thread (video/audio), so a slow or congested link can
delay outgoing frames without ever delaying newly-read input. Video frames
are compressed in three stacked, lossless layers before being written to the
socket: 8x8 tile diffing against the last frame actually sent (skips pixels
that didn't change), optional per-frame palette/indexed-color encoding when
a frame (or tile set) uses 256 colors or fewer, and raw deflate over the
result. Audio is currently sent as uncompressed 16-bit PCM at the GBA's
reported sample rate (typically 32768 Hz).

This is LAN-only by design (no TLS, no authentication, no NAT traversal)
and supports one connected client per player slot at a time. See the
[latest release](https://github.com/alwe2710/dolphin-gba-stream/releases/latest)
for a fuller rundown of what's included. Everything else in this README
describes upstream Dolphin, which this fork otherwise tracks.

### Building this fork

No extra build steps beyond a normal Dolphin build: **GBA (Client-Stream)**
lives entirely inside the existing `USE_MGBA` CMake option (`ON` by default),
the same option that already gates **GBA (Integrated)** support, so:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

is still the only thing you need before running the usual
[Linux/macOS](#building-for-linux-and-macos),
[Windows](#building-for-windows), or [Android](#building-for-android) build
steps below — this pulls in `Externals/mGBA`, which both GBA device types
require. The only additional dependency the fork's networking/compression
code needs, `zlib`, is auto-detected like Dolphin's other bundled externals
(system `zlib` if present and new enough, otherwise the vendored
`Externals/zlib-ng` is built automatically) — nothing to install by hand.
Building with `-DUSE_MGBA=OFF` compiles a Dolphin without either GBA device
type, identical to how upstream behaves today.

## System Requirements

### Desktop

* OS
    * Windows (10 1903 or higher).
    * Linux.
    * macOS (11.0 Big Sur or higher).
    * Unix-like systems other than Linux are not officially supported but might work.
* Processor
    * A CPU with SSE2 support.
    * A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.
* Graphics
    * A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 3.3).
    * A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.

### Android

* OS
    * Android (7.0 Nougat or higher).
* Processor
    * A processor with support for 64-bit applications (either ARMv8 or x86-64).
* Graphics
    * A graphics processor that supports OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher. Performance varies heavily with [driver quality](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2013/09/26/dolphin-emulator-and-opengl-drivers-hall-fameshame/).
    * A graphics processor that supports standard desktop OpenGL features is recommended for best performance.

Dolphin can only be installed on devices that satisfy the above requirements. Attempting to install on an unsupported device will fail and display an error message.

## Building

You may find building instructions on the appropriate wiki page for your operating system:

* [Windows](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/wiki/Building-for-Windows)
* [Linux](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/wiki/Building-for-Linux)
* [macOS](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/wiki/Building-for-macOS)
* [Android](#android-specific-instructions) <!-- TODO: Create a "Building for Android" wiki page and link it here -->
* [OpenBSD](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/wiki/Building-for-OpenBSD) (unsupported)

Before building, make sure to pull all submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Android-specific instructions

These instructions assume familiarity with Android development. If you do not have an
Android dev environment set up, see [AndroidSetup.md](AndroidSetup.md).

If using Android Studio, import the Gradle project located in `./Source/Android`.

Android apps are compiled using a build system called Gradle. Dolphin's native component,
however, is compiled using CMake. The Gradle script will attempt to run a CMake build
automatically while building the Java code.

## Uninstalling

On Windows, simply remove the extracted directory, unless it was installed with the NSIS installer,
in which case you can uninstall Dolphin like any other Windows application.

Linux users can run `cat install_manifest.txt | xargs -d '\n' rm` as root from the build directory
to uninstall Dolphin from their system.

macOS users can simply delete Dolphin.app to uninstall it.

Additionally, you'll want to remove the global user directory if you don't plan on reinstalling Dolphin.

  -a AUDIO_EMULATION, --audio_emulation=AUDIO_EMULATION
                        Choose audio emulation from [HLE|LLE]
```

Available DSP emulation engines are HLE (High Level Emulation) and
LLE (Low Level Emulation). HLE is faster but less accurate whereas
LLE is slower but close to perfect. Note that LLE has two submodes (Interpreter and Recompiler)
but they cannot be selected from the command line.

Available video backends are "D3D" and "D3D12" (they are only available on Windows), "OGL", and "Vulkan".
There's also "Null", which will not render anything, and
"Software Renderer", which uses the CPU for rendering and
is intended for debugging purposes only.
